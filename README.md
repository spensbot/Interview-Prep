# Interview-Prep
A bunch of custom-implemented algorithms and data-structures. Made using C++, Python, and Javascript to prep myself for interviews.

## Contains
- DataStructure
- Algorithms
- Timing Utilites for Benchmarking
- General exercises for solidifying my knowledge of various aspects of a given language

## My Favorite Examples
- binaryTrees.cpp
- graph.cpp
- sort2.cpp
